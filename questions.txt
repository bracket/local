Valuation
    1) What will the final acquisition cost be?

    2) What should I expect the sale price of the bar to be if I sell in:
        a) One year
        b) Two years
        c) Five years
        d) Ten years

    3) What loans and obligations exist already?

    4) What are the trends of property values in this area?
        - Nearby house on Fremont on Grand went up 8% in the past two years.
          This building went up 31%.  Lot next door went up 25%


Space
    1) What are the terms of the current lease?
        - To the end up September 2024 with slowly increasing rent.

    2) What is the current value of the building?
        - 3.122 million dollars in 2019.  2.383 million dollars in 2017.
          increase in 31% over last two years.

        a) What insurances can I create if the value of the building goes up
        dramatically and rent proportionately increases at the end of the lease
        agreement?
            - Maybe I can negotiate a longer lease after Covid is settled.
              Covid will probably also have an effect on property values.
            - Tie rent to the RMV value of the building.
        

    3) What terms can I get given the business may need to be fully or
       partially closed for sustained periods during the pandemic?

           - The current rent is already increasing on a particular scale over
             the next two years (though not exceedingly rapidly).  It may be
             possible to negotiate a lower rent and slower increase now and a
             higher rent and more rapid increase later.

       a) Is it possible to tie reduced rent to which phase of reopening we're
       in?
            - We'll see
    

    4) If we get the lot next door:
        a) What are the lease terms?

        b) What is the value of the property?
            - 228,790 in 2019.  185,450 in 2017.  Increase of 23% over last two
              years.

        c) Also insurances can I create against dramatic property value and
        rent increases?
            - Negotiate for a longer lease or buy the property outright.


Contingencies
    1) What can you do to insure this place survives if something happens to you?

    2) Can we get liability insurance for Corona?  What happens if a
    Coronavirus outbreak is traced to the bar?

    3) What risk do I need to incorporate for poorly enforced Coronavirus protocols?


Income
    1) Grosses for 7/21/2020

    2) Regular gross during Covid
        a) ~300 a day (optimistic)
        b) Event days ~ 675
            - ~600 taken during the event directly
