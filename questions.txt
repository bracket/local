Valuation
    1) What will the final acquisition cost be?

    2) What should I expect the sale price of the bar to be if I sell in:
        a) One year
        b) Two years
        c) Five years
        d) Ten years

    3) What loans and obligations exist already?

    4) What are the trends of property values in this area?


Space
    1) What are the terms of the current lease?

    2) What is the current value of the building?

        a) What insurances can I create if the value of the building goes up
        dramatically and rent proportionately increases at the end of the lease
        agreement?

    3) What terms can I get given the business may need to be fully or
       partially closed for sustained periods during the pandemic?

       a) Is it possible to tie reduced rent to which phase of reopening we're
       in?

    4) If we get the lot next door:
        a) What are the lease terms?

        b) What is the value of the property?

        c) Also insurances can I create against dramatic property value and
        rent increases?





I will need to make per month revenue and cost estimates for every month the
end of 2022, taking into account time of year, and phase of reopening,
including potentially reverting to previous phases and flu season.

By day-of-week breakdown would be nice for my reference but are not necessary.

To do that I will need as detailed data as I can get from the start of 2018 to
as late as possible of the following:

      - Power
